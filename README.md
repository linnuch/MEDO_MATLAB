# MEDO_MATLAB
 This project provides an open-source MATLAB code of Maxwell’s equations derived optimization (MEDO). Use it at own your risk please.
 
 MEDO is a novel optimization algorithm, which is particularly suitable for electromagnetic optimization problems. The algorithm focuses the time-varying's effect on a coaxial, and simplifies the coaxial to be a parallel circuit. One part of the conductor in the circuit is treated as the individual to explore the search space, which is named as ‘slide bar’. Another part of conductor next to the slide bar is treated as the region to be optimized, which is of the same shape with the objective function. According to the numerical tests, MEDO is proved to an effective optimization algorithm for both unimodal and multimodal functions.

This sample code is provided for educational purposes only. Please read the referred paper to better understand the usage and the inner-workings of the algorithm.
